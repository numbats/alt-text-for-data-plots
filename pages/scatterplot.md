### Example

**Alt text**: Scatterplot of fitted values on the x-axis and residual values on the vertical axis. The x-axis has tick marks 10, 15, 20, 25, and the y-axis has tick marks -5, 0, 5. There is a slight U-shape patterns to the points with one point with lower x-value than others at -12.5, and a high y-value of 7.5.

**Caption**: Examining the fit of a linear model of miles per gallon on horsepower. Residuals are plotted vertically and fitted values horizontally. The pattern suggests some non-linear relationship is not captured by the model.
