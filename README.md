# Some guidance for writing alt text for data plots

## Why?

Alt text provides a textual alternative to non-text content in HTML documents. It serves various purposes: 

- it is necessary to for accessibility guidelines. 
- ensures your data visualisations communicate to everybody.
- assistive technologies can convert alt text into other formats such as speech or Braille, providing a description for people using screen reading software.
- alt text is displayed in place of the figure if it fails to load, or is viewed in a text-based browser. 
- alt text can assist both general and image-specific search engines.
